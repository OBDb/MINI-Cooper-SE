    description: "The first MINI Cooper SE represented the brand's first mass-production all-electric vehicle, based on the F56 third-generation MINI Hardtop platform. Powered by a front-mounted electric motor producing 181 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of instant torque, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 6.9 seconds. The 32.6 kWh lithium-ion battery provided an EPA-rated range of 110 miles (WLTP: 145-167 miles), with DC fast-charging capability allowing an 80% charge in about 35 minutes. The relatively modest battery size was a deliberate choice to maintain the MINI's characteristic handling by limiting weight increase and preserving interior space. Visually distinguished from conventional MINI models by its enclosed grille with yellow accent bar, unique wheel designs, and yellow 'S' badging. The Cooper SE featured a specially calibrated suspension to handle the additional weight of the battery while maintaining MINI's signature 'go-kart' handling characteristics. The interior retained MINI's distinctive design elements with the addition of a digital instrument cluster displaying EV-specific information. Four driving modes allowed tailoring of regenerative braking strength and throttle response, with the strongest regeneration setting enabling true one-pedal driving. Standard equipment was generous, including LED headlights, heated seats, and advanced navigation with charging station information. Despite its limited range compared to some competitors, the Cooper SE found success by offering the brand's distinctive character and driving dynamics in a zero-emission package, appealing particularly to urban drivers and MINI enthusiasts seeking an electric option."

  - name: "Second Generation (J01)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Cooper SE represents a complete redesign built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform developed jointly with Chinese partner Great Wall Motor, separating it from combustion-engine MINI models for the first time. The exterior adopts MINI's new minimalist design language with cleaner surfacing, redesigned lighting elements, and a more sophisticated appearance. Available in two versions: the standard Cooper SE with a 40.7 kWh battery providing approximately 190 miles of range and 184 horsepower, and the Cooper SE with a larger battery offering around 250 miles of range and 218 horsepower. Both versions deliver improved performance compared to the previous generation, with the top variant achieving 0-62 mph in approximately 6.7 seconds. DC fast charging capability has been enhanced, allowing charging from 10-80% in under 30 minutes. The interior features a revolutionary redesign centered around a large round 9.4-inch OLED touchscreen that incorporates most vehicle functions, with minimal physical buttons remaining. This screen also serves as the primary ambient lighting element, capable of displaying various patterns and animations corresponding to different driving modes and functions. Advanced technology includes an augmented reality navigation system, sophisticated voice control, and enhanced driver assistance features. Despite the comprehensive redesign, the Cooper SE maintains similar dimensions to its predecessor, focusing on improved efficiency, range, and technology rather than increased size. This second generation represents MINI's commitment to electrification as a core part of the brand's future, with the electric Cooper SE now developed as a purpose-built EV rather than a conversion of an existing combustion-engine model."
